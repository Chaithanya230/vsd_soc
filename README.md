<h2>Day1-Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK</h2>
<h3>How to talk to computers?</h3>
<h3>Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs</h3>
<h4>BOARD DIAGRAM</h4>




#### Different Chip Components 
1. **Pads:** Signals can be sent inside and outside the chips through pads.

2. **Core:** A place where all digial logic gates are placed.

3. **Die:** Present at the corner. it is the size of the entire chip.

4. **Foundry IPs (Intellectual Properties):** Foundry IPs are pre-designed, pre-verified, and pre-characterized functional blocks provided by semiconductor foundries.

5. **Macros:** Macros are reusable blocks of custom-designed logic created by chip designers or third-party IP providers.

<h3> Introduction to RISC-V</h3>

#### RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles. It offers flexibility, scalability, and customization for various applications, from embedded systems to high-performance computing.Basically it is a language of the computer and the way we talk to it.
